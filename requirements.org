* workerbee

Track tasks, dependencies between tasks, and the workers working on them

** Sample Task Tree

   Widgit A  Widgit B   Sprog
       \         \       /
        \         \     / 
         \       Carriage
          \          /    
           \        /   Pin
            \      /   /
             \    /   /
             Full Gizmo

 - Task tree is specified in configuration (static)
 - Worker assignment to nodes is dynamic   (edit via HTTP API)

** Components to build

 - Configuration file
 - Web server
 - Client
 - Tests

 (See the Trello board!)


** Out of scope

There are a few things we won't worry about today:

 - HTML Frontend (for another meetup, we can build it in reflex)
 - Authentication/Authorization
 - Horizontal scaling (global state will live in the server)
 - Data migrations
